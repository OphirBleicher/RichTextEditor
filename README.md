# Rich Text Editor
This app can edit, show and manage rich text files.

Rich text files are files with a .rtf file extension.

> Note that the help file can be accessed with the ? mark in the toolbar, or with the menu: Help|Help Topics.

The app supports multi-window threading, which means that it supports managing many files at once.

It can also open directories, like in this image:
